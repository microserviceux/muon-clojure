# muon-clojure

A Clojure client/server library for interacting with Muon microservices.

## Installation

`muon-clojure` is deployed in clojars.org:

`[io.muoncore/muon-clojure "6.4-20160412105345"]`

## Usage

### Client API

To import the library:

```clojure
(use 'muon-clojure.client)
```

#### Creating a muon client

```clojure
(def m (muon-client "amqp://mq-url" "service-name" "tag1" "tag2" "tag3"))
```

#### Sending a query or command

```clojure
(with-muon m (request! "request://target-service/endpoint" {:foo "bar"}))
```

#### Subscribe to a stream

```clojure
(require '[clojure.core.async :as async :refer [go <!]])

(let [ch (with-muon m (subscribe! "stream://target-service/endpoint"
                                  :from 0
                                  :stream-type "hot-cold"
                                  :stream-name "my-stream"))]
  (go (loop [elem (<! ch)] (println (pr-str elem)) (recur (<! ch)))))
```

#### Send an event to an eventstore

NOTE: This functionality is only available if there is an eventstore available subscribed to the same AMQP server. If you see the following message when initialising the client:

```
INFO  client:6 - Eventstore not found, event functionality not available!
```

then the calls to `(event)` won't be successful.

```clojure
(with-muon m (event! {:event-type "type" :stream-name "my-stream" :payload {:my :data}}))
```

For an explanation of the possible fields of the event, please refer to [https://github.com/microserviceux/documentation/blob/master/implementmuon/protocol/event/v1.adoc](https://github.com/microserviceux/documentation/blob/master/implementmuon/protocol/event/v1.adoc).

## Server API

In order to run a microservice in server mode, you will need to provide an implementation and start/stop the instance by means of the `component` library.

### Providing an implementation

An implementation of a microservice endpoints consists in a reification of the `muon-clojure.server/[MicroserviceStream,MicroserviceEvent,MicroserviceRequest]` protocols. Each of them is optional, and they serve different purposes:

* `MicroserviceStream` allows to expose subscription endpoints that should return a channel.
* `MicroserviceEvent` allows to expose an endpoint that will process (e.g. store) an event. These endpoints, in order to be compliant with the Muon Event protocol, should return the same event with an `order-id` and `event-time` filled. Please check the [https://github.com/microserviceux/documentation/blob/master/implementmuon/protocol/event/v1.adoc](schema docs).
* `MicroserviceRequest` allows to expose endpoints that should return and/or do something based on the parameters.

Example:

```clojure
(require '[muon-clojure.server :as mcs])

(defrecord MyMicroservice [my-params]
  mcs/MicroserviceStream
  (stream-mappings [this]
    [{:endpoint "stream1" :type :cold
      :fn-process (fn [params]
                    (clojure.core.async/to-chan [{:val 1} {:val 2}]))}
     {:endpoint "stream" :type :hot-cold
      :fn-process (fn [params]
                    (clojure.core.async/to-chan [{:val 1} {:val 2}]))}])
  mcs/MicroserviceEvent
  (handle-event [this event]
    (do #_something)
    (merge event {:order-id 1 :event-time 1}))
  mcs/MicroserviceRequest
  (request-mappings [this]
    [{:endpoint "projection"
      ;; As an example, we return the same payload that we receive
      :fn-process identity}]))
```
